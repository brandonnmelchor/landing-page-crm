# Landing-Page-02

I created a Product Landing Page using vanilla HTML and CSS. This is basically the same as my first one, but I made some minor changes to the code for The Odin Project. The web page is responsive to viewport size. All text material on this page was taken from [Insightly](https://www.insightly.com/crm/).
